# PC-Alarm
For April Fool's Day coming up I created a powershell script that will wait for an unsuspecting user to come along and move the mouse.  When they do it will start looping a very annoying car alarm.   


    TURN YOUR SPEAKERS ALL THE WAY UP!!!!!!
    Use this to run @ work - Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pc_alarm.ps1
    Created with PS2.0 -> only version available at work
    Press Ctr-C at the command prompt to exit the script without setting off the alarm or ctr-c to exit when it is going off
